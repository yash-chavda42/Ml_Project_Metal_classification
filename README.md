# Ml_Project_Metal_classification
classification based on metal surface
Cnn_with_equal_images -> Cnn with 980 image
Code_For_Knn -> this code is done in supercomputer 
Code_for_RF -> this code is done in supercomputer
Desicion_tree_with_7000_images based on pixel -> Desicion Tree with unbalanced dataset with pixel val
Desicion_tree_with_equal_image based on pixel -> Desicion Tree with balanced dataset with pixel val(each class with 245 images)
Feature Selection Method -> Wrapper Method,Filter Method
GlCM Method -> feature Extraction Method (total 120 feature)
RF_with_feature_feature extraction -> Random forest with Glcm Method 
Random Forest, Svm, Desicion tree using Pca -> Random forest,Desicion Tree, Svm with Glcm Method(here dataset used after augmentation method because of unbalanced data)
Random_forest_with_7000_images -> Random Forest with unbalanced dataset with Glcm Method 
Random_forest_with_equal_image -> Random Forest with balanced dataset with Glcm Method(980 imags)
